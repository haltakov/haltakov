I'm Vladimir and I've been building software products for over 20 years. I'm currently working as a solo founder, and AI is an indispensable part of my journey — integrated into the products I build, supporting me in areas where I lack expertise, and helping me brainstorm new ideas.

I studied Computer Science in Sofia, Bulgaria, then moved to Munich, Germany, for a Master’s program in Robotics. That’s where I got deeply interested in Computer Vision and Machine Learning, which led me to pursue a PhD at the Technical University of Munich as part of the BMW PhD program.

For a large part of my career, I worked at BMW, developing camera-based driver assistance systems and programming features for their autonomous driving initiative. Eventually, I grew tired of the big company environment and joined a startup in the crypto and cybersecurity space in 2022.

Throughout all these years, I’ve worked on countless side projects — and now I’ve decided to turn them into my full-time work and be my own boss.
